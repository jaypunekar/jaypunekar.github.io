*<b>Dome Projection Mapping</b>*

### Project:
  - I worked on a dome projection mapping project where the visuals were projected onto a 10-meter geodesic dome. The goal was to create a fully immersive experience with precise alignment and seamless blending of visuals across the curved surface of the dome.

### Equipment:
  - I used four short-throw projectors to ensure that the visuals covered the entire dome surface without distortion.
  - A powerful media server equipped with an Nvidia Quadro graphics card was responsible for handling the visual data. The Quadro card was crucial for rendering the high-quality visuals required for such an immersive projection.
  - The visuals were captured using a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV camera, paired with a Canon EF 8-15mm f/4L Fisheye USM lens. This lens was chosen specifically for its ability to capture wide-angle images, which are essential for dome projection.

### Software:
  - Vioso 6 was used to handle the complex task of warping, blending, and calibrating the visuals across the dome's surface. Its advanced features made it possible to achieve a perfect alignment between the projectors.
  - NestMap software played a key role in mapping and aligning the visuals on the dome. It provided the necessary tools to ensure that the images were correctly placed and blended across the domeâ€™s curved surface.
  - NestPlay Lite was utilized to manage content playback. It ensured that the visual content was played smoothly and in sync across all the projectors, which is crucial for maintaining the immersive experience.
  - The EOS Webcam Utility Software allowed me to monitor the setup in real-time. This was particularly useful for making adjustments on the fly and ensuring that everything was running as expected.

### Outcome:
  - By combining all this equipment and software, I was able to create a seamless and highly immersive visual experience on the dome. The projectors, media server, and software all worked together to produce a stunning display that covered the entire surface of the dome with perfectly aligned and blended visuals.
