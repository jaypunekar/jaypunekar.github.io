I have showcased some of my Major End-To-End Projects on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science and Python (And, YES! I know Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning). I have also given detailed desciption for each project and if I have written a tutorial on it I will also add the link.
To see all my projects go to my [Github](https://github.com/jaypunekar).

The <b>Voucher Automation Software Suite</b> is a streamlined solution for automating voucher management processes. Developed using Python, MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL database), XML, CustomTkinter, and Tkinter, this suite includes three integrated applications:

1. <b>TallyClient:</b> Allows users to create and store vouchers in MongoDB Atlas.
2. <b>TallyMain:</b> Approves vouchers based on predefined rules and integrates them with Tally ERP 9.
3. <b>TallyAccounts:</b> Handles payment processing of approved vouchers, requiring payee signatures for authorization and marking vouchers as "paid" before integration back into Tally ERP 9.

This suite enhances efficiency, accuracy, and real-time financial management for businesses.
