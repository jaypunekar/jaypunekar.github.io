Welcome to my portfolio! I am a BSc Mathematics graduate currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from COEP Technological University. My journey so far has been very diverse, encompassing hands-on experience with projection mapping, static web development, drone swarming, and microcontrollers(ESP8266/ESP32). 

I have had the opportunity to work on Virtual Reality syncing and collaborate with former ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) scientists on multiple hardware projects at Suresh Naik Space Park in Pune. Currently, I am diving deep into the fields of Data Science and AI/ML, exploring their vast potentials and applications.

This portfolio website is a space where I share my knowledge and insights. You’ll find tutorials on niche topics such as drone swarming and projection mapping—areas with limited resources available online—as well as blog posts discussing various aspects of data science and artificial intelligence.
