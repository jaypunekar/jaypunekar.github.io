**Welcome!**

I am a BSc Mathematics graduate currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My professional journey includes hands-on experience with microcontrollers such as ESP8266 and ESP32, projection mapping, static web development, drone swarming, and software development using Python.

I have worked on VR syncing using Oculus Quest and have had the privilege of collaborating with former ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) scientists on multiple hardware projects at Suresh Naik Space Park in Pune. Currently, I am deeply immersed in exploring the field of Data Science and AI/ML.

This portfolio website serves as a hub for sharing my knowledge and experiences. Here, you'll find tutorials on niche topics like drone swarming and projection mapping, which are not easily accessible on the internet. Additionally, I will be posting blogs discussing various aspects of data science and artificial intelligence (also Python ofc).
